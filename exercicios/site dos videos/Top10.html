<p>I can't believe it. After what might be the worse experience someone has ever had in this game I've pulled through. I started this level July of 2020 back when my hardest was cataclysm. It was always something fun to play in the background, just to see if I could make any progress. After I beat Bloodbath I wanted to push myself a bit further. After some attempts I cleared every part of the level and started to string together small runs. I did 62-100, 10%, 24-63 and a couple other small runs. Then I took a small break to beat Black Blizzard which would end up being my hardest demon completed before beating Silent clubstep. After this break I continued to play silent clubstep, being the 3rd person to do 48-100 and tying Hyperbola for the world record at 15%. I was trying my hardest to pass 15% and get world record until paqoe swept in and got it before me (foreshadowing?). I rerouted my goals and tried to be the first person to have the level in 2 runs. I was the 2nd person behind hyperbola to do 24-100 and shortly after I got 27%, being the first person ever to have the level in 2 runs and getting my first world record. When I did this there was no looking back. I wanted to beat this level as soon as possible. I got 31% and then 33%. I extended the world record all the way to 65%. I also set world record runs of 14-100 and 12-100 and did those runs multiple times. For a little bit I really thought I could verify the level but you guys all know the story about the verification race. I slowly inched my way passed the dual and reached final 8 jumps and ship section. I died passed the dual a total of 6 times before completing the level. And now 820k attempts and 3 years later I can finally say I beat silent clubstep. I truly would not be here right now if it wasn't for you guys reading this. I cant thank everyone individually but I do have thank you messages for some people.

    Zoe - The one and only verifier of silent clubstep. Such a prestigious title only 1 person will ever hold. Even though we were against each other in the verification "race," she was one of my biggest supporters throughout. Couldn't be more happy competing with anyone else.
    
    Hyperbola - Where do I even start. A very early supporter of mine, and one of the founding fathers of silent clubstep progress. The person to prove time and time again that one day, silent clubstep will be beaten. Without the standard hyperbola set, I'm not sure if we would of seen silent clubstep be verified back in July 2022
    
    Septagon7 - Your early runs are a key piece to the silent clubstep puzzle and inspiring to many people, including me. The only words to describe your progress back when I started was "magical".
    
    Error - Right up there with septa and hyperbola during the early progress days. You 3 gave me motivation to power through everything and continue in your footsteps. All the way to the finish line.
    
    Final attempt count : 821,027
    Worst Fails : 78, 76, 75, 74, 72x2, and over 60 deaths at the dual
    
    76% and 78% were achieved in 2023 not 2022. Editing mistake!
    
    Thank you guys ❤️</p>
